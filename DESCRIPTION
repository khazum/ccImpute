Description: Dropout events make the lowly expressed genes indistinguishable 
	from true zero expression and different than the low expression present in 
	cells of the same type. This issue makes any subsequent downstream analysis 
	difficult. ccImpute is an imputation algorithm that uses cell similarity 
	established by consensus clustering to impute the most probable dropout 
	events in the scRNA-seq datasets. ccImpute demonstrated performance which
	exceeds the performance of existing imputation approaches while introducing
	the least amount of new noise as measured by clustering performance 
	characteristics on datasets with known cell identities.
